Problem1:Max Consecutive Ones
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Code:

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        c=0
        max_count=0
        for i in range(0,len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==1:
                c=c+1
                if(c>max_count):
                    max_count=c
            else:
                c=0
                continue
        return(max_count)    
        
        
        
        
Problem2:Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits  
Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
